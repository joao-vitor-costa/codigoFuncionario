#### Technical Overview:
- Java 8.
- Swing framework.
- SOLID.
- Design Patterns.

The Swing Application Framework (JSR 296) is a Java specification for a simple application framework for Swing applications, with a graphical user interface (GUI) in computer software. It defines the infrastructure common to most desktop applications, making it easy to create Swing applications.

SOLID is an acronym for the first five principles of object-oriented programming and code design identified by Robert C. Martin (or Uncle Bob) around the year 2000. The acronym SOLID was introduced by Michael Feathers, after noting that the five principles could fit this word.
- Principle of Single Responsibility
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Replacement Principle
- Principle of Interface Segregation
- Dependency inversion principle

Design Patterns or design patterns are general solutions to recurring problems during software development. It is not a framework or ready code, but a high-level definition of how a common problem can be solved.

#### Design patterns applied:
- Abstract Factory
- Adapter
- DAO
- Observer
- State
- Strategy

#### Project for academic purposes.
